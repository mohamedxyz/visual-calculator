# visual-calculator
a visual calculator in python
This project was meant to make a calculator in python (maybe other langauges as well)
# why this exists?
because I wanted to learn how to use github and also *maybe* contribute to the open source community because let's face it
open source programs are the future.
if you are a programmer and also a beginner then you should take a try to practise collaboration between teams or something like that
then you are welcome
